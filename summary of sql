Summary

Operation(Symbols) Purpose

Select(σ)

The SELECT operation is used for
selecting a subset of the tuples according
to a given selection condition

Projection(π)

The projection eliminates all attributes of
the input relation but those mentioned in
the projection list.

Union Operation(∪)

UNION is symbolized by symbol. It
includes all tuples that are in tables A or
in B.

Set Difference(-)

– Symbol denotes it. The result of A – B, is
a relation which includes all tuples that
are in A but not in B.

Intersection(∩)

Intersection defines a relation consisting
of a set of all tuple that are in both A and
B.

Cartesian Product(X) Cartesian operation is helpful to merge

columns from two relations.

Inner Join Inner join, includes only those tuples that

satisfy the matching criteria.

Theta Join(θ)

The general case of JOIN operation is
called a Theta join. It is denoted by
symbol θ.

EQUI Join When a theta join uses only equivalence
condition, it becomes a equi join.

Natural Join(⋈)

Natural join can only be performed if
there is a common attribute (column)
between the relations.

Outer Join In an outer join, along with tuples that

satisfy the matching criteria.

Left Outer Join( )

In the left outer join, operation allows
keeping all tuple in the left relation.

Right Outer join( )

In the right outer join, operation allows
keeping all tuple in the right relation.
